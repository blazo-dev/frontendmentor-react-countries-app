## Overview
Web application using React and SASS, leveraging the RestCountries API to display detailed information about different countries. A key highlight is that I have implemented the routing manually, giving me greater control over the application's navigation. The goal is to provide an interactive and visually appealing experience for users to easily explore and discover data about various countries.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode

- Manual React Router: I implemented routing functionality manually, gaining a deeper understanding of navigation in React.
- API Consumption: I successfully fetched data from the RestCountries API and integrated it into my application.
